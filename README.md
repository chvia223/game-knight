React Native app for Hackathon Fall 2021

# Overview


This is an app made using the React-Native framework. It was a team project entered into a Hackathon competition hosted by Brigham Young University - Idaho in the Fall of 2021. The app functions as an event scheduler with chat features that are loosely implemented at this time. There is account creation that links data to a user using Firebase to host our database.

We used EXPO Go to test our app as we developed it. If you'd like to test what we were able to finish follow the steps below.
